#1. Simulate a dataset with one X variable and one Y variable in R or Stata that does not contain a confounder or a collider. Let the relationship between Y and X be 5, that is the population parameter 𝛽5 = 5 (you can set 𝛽0 to anything you want). Assuming X causes Y, recover the coefficient on X using OLS.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

X <- floor(runif(1000, min=0, max=45))
E <- rnorm(1000, mean=0, sd=0.01)
B0 <- 2
B1 <- 5
Y <- B0 + B1*X + E
df <- data.frame(Y, X)

head(df)

```


#Recover the coefficient on X using OLS.

```{r}
OLS1 <- lm(Y~X, data=df)
OLS1
summary(OLS1)
```

#Alter your program from step 1 to include a confounder (a variable Z that is correlated with the X variable and the error term in your model).

```{r}
rnorm_pre()
```
